# Overview

This is my first program in the Java language. I want to learn the basics of Java and make a well-built game environment.

This program is a basic RPG. There is a small map that the player can move around. Basic information is provided about the player's location. There is a goblin camp that has to be found and the goblins defeated.

My purpose of writing this software was to get familiar with the Java language. I wanted to use as much of the language as I could in a real situation for a good introduction to Java.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used VSCode with OpenJDK to program this software.

This program was made in Java. I also used InputMismatchException to catch users entering the wrong type of input, Scanner to scan for input from the user, HashMap and Map to create a HashMap of player data, and Random to get random numbers in the program.

# Future Work

- Add Strength, Wisdom, etc. attributes
- Use random checks if user passes the passive/active checks
- Make a larger map with more options
